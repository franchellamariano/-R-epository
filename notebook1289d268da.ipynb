As a data analyst, it will also be common for you to import data from external files into your `R` console and use it to create a data frame to analyze it. In this activity you will learn how to import data from outside of `R` using the `read_csv()` function. Then, once you have imported a data file, you will use `R` functions to manipulate and interact with that data.\n\nYou can start importing and exploring data with the code chunks in the RMD space. To interact with the code chunk, click the green arrow in the top-right corner of the chunk. The executed code will appear in the RMD space and your console. \n\nThroughout this activity, you will also have the opportunity to practice writing your own code by making changes to the code chunks yourself.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Load Packages","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Import Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"bookings_df <- read_csv(\"hotel_bookings.csv\")","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Inspect & Clean Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"head(bookings_df)\ncolnames(bookings_df)\nstr(bookings_df)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Create another data frame using `bookings_df` that focuses on the average daily rate, which is referred to as `adr` in the data frame, and  `adults`","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"new_df <- select(bookings_df, `adr`, adults)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To create new variables in your data frame, you can use the `mutate()` function.
