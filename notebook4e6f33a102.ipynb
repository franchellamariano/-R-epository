A data frame is a collection of columns containing data, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table. Data frames are one of the basic tools you will use to work with data in `R`. And you can create data frames from different data sources.  \n\nThere are three common sources for data:\n\n- A`package` with data that can be accessed by loading that `package`\n- An external file like a spreadsheet or CSV that can be imported into `R`\n- Data that has been generated from scratch using `R` code\n\nWherever data comes from, you will almost always want to store it in a data frame object to work with it. Now, you can start creating and exploring data frames with the code chunks in the RMD space. To interact with the code chunk, click the green arrow in the top-right corner of the chunk. The executed code will appear in the RMD space and your console.\n\nThroughout this activity, you will also have the opportunity to practice writing your own code by making changes to the code chunks yourself.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Loading Packages","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Create a Dataframe","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"names <- c(\"Fran\", \"Maria\", \"Rodrigo\", \"Franchella\")\nage <- c(54, 63, 22, 20)\npeople <- data.frame(names, age)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Inspect the Dataframe","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"head(people)\nstr(people)\nglimpse(people)\ncolnames(people)\nmutate(people, age_in_20 = age + 20)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Create a Fruit Dataframe","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fruit <- c(\"Banana\", \"Apple\", \"Peach\", \"Mango\", \"Strawberry\")","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, create a new vector with a number representing your own personal rank for each fruit.
