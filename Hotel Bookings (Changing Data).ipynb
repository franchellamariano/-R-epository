You will learn more about functions you can use to manipulate your data, use statistical summaries to explore your data, and gain initial insights for your stakeholders. \n\nThroughout this activity, you will also have the opportunity to practice writing your own code by making changes to the code chunks yourself.\n## The Scenario\nIn this scenario, you are a junior data analyst working for a hotel booking company. You have been asked to clean a .csv file that was created after querying a database to combine two different tables from different hotels. You have already performed some basic cleaning functions on this data; this activity will focus on using functions to conduct basic data manipulation.","metadata":{"_uuid":"051d70d956493feee0c6d64651c6a088724dca2a","_execution_state":"idle"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Load Packages","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"skimr\")\ninstall.packages(\"janitor\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(janitor)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Import Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"hotel_bookings <- read_csv(\"hotel_bookings.csv\")","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Get to Know the Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"head(hotel_bookings)\nstr(hotel_bookings)\nglimpse(hotel_bookings)\ncolnames(hotel_bookings)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Manipulating the Data\nLet's say you want to arrange the data by most lead time to least lead time because you want to focus on bookings that were made far in advance.
